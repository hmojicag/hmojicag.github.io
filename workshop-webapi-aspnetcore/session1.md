## What's .Net Core
[.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/about) is an open-source, general-purpose development platform maintained by Microsoft and the .NET community on GitHub. It's cross-platform (supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux) and can be used to build device, cloud, and IoT applications.

## Run a Hello World

You must already have installed .Net Core, see [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/hello-world-tutorial/install) for how to do it.

We will create a new Console project called HelloWorldApp and run it:

```
  mkdir HelloWorldApp
  cd HelloWorldApp
  dotnet new console
  dotnet run
```
