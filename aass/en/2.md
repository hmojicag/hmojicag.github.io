    - There's something that always traumatizes me. I know that public sewer system is an incredible invention. I mean, it's better than putting the waste in a bucket and then throwing it out the window. That everything goes down the pipe is .... very practical. BUT!!!
    - That means that inside all buildings, streets and houses there is always shit. Circulating as if it were blood inside the arteries.
    - We live in a shit world!
