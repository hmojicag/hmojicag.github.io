    - Hazel: Stupid company network, everything is blocked. No Youtube, Spotify, Facebook. Dammit, not even Stackoverflow.
    - Hazel: I waste more time working around network blocks looking for alternatives than doing actual work. This is making me really unhappy.
    - Robot: Policy number 666 "An unhappy employee is a good employee". I see our network block is working according to our policies.
    - Hazel: It's making me unproductive and very unhappy.
    - Robot: Policy 666 validated My job here is done
