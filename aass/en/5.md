    - Hazel: Why are you so happy?
    - Erick: They pay me to do something I love. That makes me happy
    - Hazel: For every penny they pay you this company makes 10 more
    - Erick: If the company is doing good, then is good for me
    - Hazel: That's a very stupid way of thinking. You should only be happy when the company pays you the money you actually make for them
    - Erick: Oh I didn't know that. What should I do while I wait for the company to pay me what I really deserve?.
    - Hazel: I haven't though about that. I didn't think somebody will actually listen to me.
