    - Robot boss: To be able to program a computer will be assigned to you, you will use it to make remote desktop to a VDI, in the VDI you need to run an Ubuntu VM, within Ubuntu initiate an SSH session to a "secure" server.
    - Robot boss: Inside the "secure" server you can program using the Emacs CLI.
    - Ab: We need to do all that because the code is very valuable and we need a safe environment, right?
    - Robot boss: Wrong, it's because we hate employees and love to see them suffer when there's lag in the network.
    - Ab: But, being a enterprise network there is no lag, right?
    - Robot boss: Hahaha!!, employees are really funny.
