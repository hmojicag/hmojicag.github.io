    - At last I'm home after another unproductive day where the only thing I did was sell my time and enrich my employer
    - Now I'm going to do something productive, I will continue with my freelance projects or perhaps  I will resume the course of discrete optimization in coursera, maybe better I should workout....
    - Me every day after wasting 12hrs "working."
