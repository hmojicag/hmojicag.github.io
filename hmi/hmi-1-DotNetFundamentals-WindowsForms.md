In order to follow up this course you will need some background knowledge, mainly basic  programming skills and at least some experience in C#.

> C# is a language for professional programming. C# (pronounced C sharp) is a programming language designed for building a wide range of enterprise applications that run on the .NET Framework.
> The goal of C# is to provide a simple, safe, modern, object-oriented, highperformance , robust and durable language for .NET development.
> Also it enables developers to build solutions for the broadest range of clients, including Web applications, Microsoft Windows Forms-based applications, and thin- and smart-client devices.
