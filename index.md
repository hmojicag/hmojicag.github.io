Hello I'm Hazael Mojica, I'm a professional Software Developer living in Monterrey MÃ©xico, I like long fantasy books, programming, tacos and chihuahua dogs.

Between my hobbies you'll find going hiking to the mountains, biking, expresso coffee and teaching tech stuff to strangers on the Internet.

BTW I also have a full time job as developer and part time teacher in FIME UANL.

Wanna learn something? Just scroll down...
